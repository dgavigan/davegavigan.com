### Role: Lead Developer
As an early engineer and lead developer, I was instrumental in the platform's development, particularly in the frontend. I managed and guided remote contractors, and mentoring engineers.

### Technical Focus
I led the frontend development, ensuring the platform was intuitive and efficient. My work included integrating various IoT solutions and data visualization tools, crucial for the platform's agricultural focus.

### Management and Team Coordination
My role extended to overseeing remote contractors, providing them with guidance and ensuring cohesive development efforts.

### Contribution to the Platform's Evolution
From its inception as a broad IoT platform, my contributions helped shape SensorInsight.io into a tailored solution for vineyard management, focusing on critical areas like soil health, irrigation, and crop monitoring.

### Impact
The platform's evolution under my guidance significantly improved its applicability in precision agriculture, especially for vineyards, aiding farmers in making data-driven decisions for optimal crop yield and quality.
