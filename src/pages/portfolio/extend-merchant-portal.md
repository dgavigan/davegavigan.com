### Project Overview
[The Extend Merchant Portal](https://docs.extend.com/docs/merchant-portal) is a browser-based application designed for merchants to manage their warranty programs. Initially a basic tool, the project's goal was to elevate its performance and establish it as a benchmark for other engineering teams at Extend. This included adding advanced features like contract and claim management, and enterprise functionalities such as Okta Login/SSO.

### Your Role and Evolution
As a Staff Web Engineer, I set overall best practices and guidance to the team, acting in a lead capacity. Transitioning to an Engineering Manager, I focused on team development and ensuring the technical soundness of the project.

### Technical Challenges and Solutions
The portal, initially developed by contractors and junior engineers, suffered from suboptimal practices. I addressed these by:
- Refactoring code to align with React best practices.
- Simplifying overly complex structures created by less experienced seniors.
- Establishing standards for efficient and effective React application development.

### Management Challenges and Strategies
As a manager, I faced the challenge of leading a diverse team, including underperforming engineers I hadn't hired. My approach was:
- Personalized development plans to bridge skill gaps.
- Creating a collaborative and engaging environment.
- Implementing office hours for peer learning and mentorship.

### Team Dynamics and Development
I fostered team growth by:
- Recruiting high-performing engineers to set performance benchmarks.
- Encouraging mentorship within the team.
- Conducting interactive sessions like mock interviews and quizzes to identify and address weaknesses in a collaborative manner.

### Team Performance Metrics
Under my leadership, the team achieved:  
- Top 75th percentile in annual story points.  
- 85th percentile in sprint completion and 75th in predictability.  
- 92nd percentile in defect resolution and 78th percentile in PR engagement.

### Impact on Extendâ€™s Business
The project significantly improved Extend's business operations, particularly for enterprise customers. It enabled better control and management of their programs and met their security and integration requirements.

### Stakeholder Feedback
The project metrics reflect the positive impact and efficiency of the team. The enhancements in the portal were well-received by users, demonstrating the effectiveness of the team's efforts and the portal's improved functionality.

### Conclusion
My journey with the Extend Merchant Portal highlights a transition from a technical expert to a strategic leader. Balancing hands-on contributions with team management, I led the team to set a high standard in web application development and significantly improve Extend's merchant-facing operations.
