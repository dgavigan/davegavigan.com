### Project Overview
Rent.com, a leading online rental marketplace, underwent a significant transformation during my tenure. The project's focus was on transitioning from a Ruby on Rails backend to a React-based frontend. This rewrite was a strategic move to enhance the site's performance and user experience.


### Role: Senior Engineer
As a Senior Engineer, I played a key role in this transition. My responsibilities included developing high-quality React components, integrating them with existing systems, and deploying them incrementally. My team and I also worked very closely with product to explore and implement variations of the site to optimze conversions .


### Technologies Used
- React and TypeScript for the frontend
- Advanced feature flagging for controlled feature releases and A/B testing
- Node/Express server delivering a GraphQL BFF API   


### Challenges & Solutions
- **Incremental Deployment:** We utilized an industry approach known as "strangler fig pattern" or "incremental rewrite," where the new system gradually replaces parts of the old.
- **Feature Management:** Heavily relied on feature flags to manage and test new features, ensuring seamless integration and user experience.
- **Backend for Frontend:** The team owned and developed their own GraphQL API to encapsulate microservices, at times needing to develop entirely new featuresets with disparate data
- **A/B Testing:** Implemented A/B testing to optimize features and improve SEO and web performance.


### Team Dynamics
The project was executed by a team of high-caliber engineers, each contributing to the meticulous rewrite process. The environment demanded a high degree of self-motivation and independent problem-solving, with a strong focus on maintaining the pace and quality of development.


### Impact on Rent.com
This extensive rewrite significantly improved the site's performance and scalability, ensuring Rent.com's competitiveness in the online rental marketplace. The introduction of a modern frontend framework and efficient feature deployment strategies enhanced user experience and site reliability.


### Conclusion
My experience at Rent.com as a Senior Engineer highlights my ability to adapt to evolving technological landscapes and contribute effectively to large-scale platform modernizations. The successful transition to a React frontend underlines my commitment to high-quality development and staying at the forefront of web technologies.
